# HabiticaText [In Progress]

Edit your todo's and habits in habitia as a text file. Allows easy organization of todos. (Also editing with VIM).

Currently abandoned, because it was really hard to debug issues, so will be resumed after creating the Bash DeBugger: https://github.com/binamkayastha/BDB

# Why I decided to write this

To learn bash, sed, awk, and grep better. And also to be able to write my todolist in a text file (and modify it with an editor like vim) but get coins and achievements with Habitica.
